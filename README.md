* Soundcheck was created as the very first group project for my coding bootcamp. One of the biggest challenges was simultaniously learning to collaborate, define and scope the project, and deploy to production on a short time frame. Developing a workflow for scrum, branching, and code review was essential to overcoming this obstacle.
